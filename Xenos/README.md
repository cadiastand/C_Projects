The program processes letter sequences and determines whether it is possible to bring them to a unified synchronized state.
It utilizes basic arithmetic operations, algorithms for finding GCD and LCM, as well as input validation.
The logic involves mathematical processing of sequences and conditions for checking synchronization.
