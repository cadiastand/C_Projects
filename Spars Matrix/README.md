This program implements a sparse matrix structure to efficiently manage matrices with mostly zero values. It supports operations like adding, setting, retrieving, and removing cells while maintaining row and column organization.

Features
Sparse Matrix Representation: Optimized storage for matrices with mostly zero elements.
Dynamic Memory Management:
Uses linked lists to store rows and columns.
Dynamically allocates memory for non-zero cells.
Supported Operations:
Add or set cell values.
Retrieve a cell value.
Remove a cell.
Print the matrix for debugging purposes.
